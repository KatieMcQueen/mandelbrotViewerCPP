create mandelbrot structure
  combine complex field structure into the mandelbrot structure
  create cli args parser
define colormap format
create colormap reader
check imports
fix makefile

Program process:
create a mandelbrot structure
(holds state values related to the mandelbrot set
(position, radius, iterations, options))
read command line arguments
store relevant arguments in the mandelbrot structure
create a colormap structure
  read the colormap in from disk
create and image writer
pass the writer the info it needs
(height, width, ect)
calculate a pixel's coordinate
evaluate that coordinate
get the color of that pixel from the iterations
write it to the image structure
repeat a lot
write the image to disk
repeat?
