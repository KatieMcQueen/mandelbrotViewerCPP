this text file attempts to document the significance of every ouput in this folder

gradientTest.png was the test image used to confirm functionality of the png writing library and my wrapper for it
firstOutput.png was the first mandelbrot image generated. I'm still not sure where the blue lines came from. 
smallTest.png was a very small test image used to make manually inspecting the program's error logs simple. there were actually about 4 of these made in short order. only one has been preserved.
blueLinesFixed.png was the first otput without the mysterious blue lines. 
backgroundSizeRed.png is the same fundamental code as blueLinesFixed.png scaled up to fit a 1920x1080 monitor
backgroundSizeRedMoreIters.png has more iterations, which made the reds more red
colormapFirstTest was the first test with a proper colormap
colormapShifted.png shifted the colormap 180 degrees for a better color pallate in my opinion
zeroBug.png was a funny bug I wanted to preserve. I initally assumed all values not in the set would be greator than 1, so I figured I could return a zero for any point "in the set" and then color any zero points black. Unfortunately points that start outside the escape radious are also zero, so this colored all those points zero as well. Interestingly this bug also revealed how badly stretched my implementation currently is. that oval represents a constant radious and should be circular.
twilightBackground.png gonna become my new background image.
I fixed the scaling and now have better backgrounds
render 10 is interesting because it demonstrates how lack of iterations can limit the depth of zooms. there are two limiting factors, precision in the arithmetic, and how many iterations your machine can handle.
